## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

### This is NOT for Immediate Clinical Use
- All data is simulated
- No actual genomic processing
- Not medically validated
- Requires comprehensive regulatory review

### Before Any Deployment:
1. Obtain institutional IRB approval
2. Conduct legal compliance review
3. Perform security audits
4. Establish community partnerships
5. Implement actual genomic pipelines
6. Obtain regulatory certification

### Data Privacy
- Design demonstrates privacy principles
- Full HIPAA/GDPR compliance requires additional work
- Consult legal and security experts before production
